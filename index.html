    <p>
        Hi there! My name is Marija Vukic, and I'm a Croatian-American pursuing
        a degree in Data Science with a minor in Applied Mathematics at UC San 
        Diego. I'm passionate about sharing my Croatian heritage and learning 
        about the narratives that have shaped others into who they are today. 
        For me, Data Science is a way to explore patterns—whether in culture, 
        history, relationships, economics, or beyond—while combining my curiosity
        for disciplines such as statistics and coding.
